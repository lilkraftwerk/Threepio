  My personal digital assistant, named after the shiny robot we love to hate
</p>

## Why

A highly specialized Telegram bot that I can use to perform a few tasks I'd otherwise have to do manually. I use Telegram for most of my personal messaging and their bot support is great, so it seemed like the best and simplest interface for performing a few easy tasks.

The original idea: in Berlin most NBA games happen while I'm asleep, so I found myself checking for the scores every morning. I decided to write a bot that would message send me the previous night's scores (and the upcoming games for the next day) so I didn't have to check manually. And once I had a working assistant bot, why not make it more useful with some more features?



This bot is highly hardcoded and relatively specific to my personal needs, so the code should be taken as more of an example than as something that can be forked and reused immediately.

## Functionality
